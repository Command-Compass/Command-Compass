## 4. Getting Started

To get started with the CLI command reference application, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli-command-reference.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

    ```bash
    cd cli-command-reference
    cd frontend
    flutter pub get

    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

3. **Backend Configuration**:
   
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the following environment variables:
    
        ```dotenv
        PORT=3000
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```

    - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection string.
    - Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a secret key for JWT token generation.

### Running the Application

4. **Start the Backend Server**: Run the Express.js backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start running on the specified port (default is 3000).

5. **Start the Flutter Frontend**:

    - For iOS:
    
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        flutter run
        ```
        
    - For Android:
    
        Connect your Android device or start an emulator, then run:
        
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        flutter run
        ```

    This will launch the CLI command reference application on your device or emulator.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run the CLI command reference application locally on your machine. You can now start exploring CLI commands, searching for specific commands, and contributing to the command database.
