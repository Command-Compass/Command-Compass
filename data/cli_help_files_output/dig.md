Explanation:

The message "Invalid option: --help" indicates that the command-line interface you are using to interact with the `dig` tool, which is a powerful DNS lookup utility used in Unix/Linux systems, does not recognize the `--help` flag as a valid argument or subcommand. Here's an explanation of how to correctly use `dig`, along with information on obtaining more detailed help:

The `dig` command can be used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers and performing various operations related to DNS lookups. The primary usage formats provided in the message are as follows:

1. General Dig Usage
   ```
   dig [@global-server] [domain] [q-type] [q-class] {q-opt} {global-d-opt} host [@local-server] {local-d-opt} [...]]
   ```
    - This usage format is for querying a global DNS server, which is responsible for maintaining records across multiple domains and networks. You can specify the domain you want to query or perform operations on by using the `domain` argument. Additionally, you may use different types of queries (such as TYPE=A, AAAA, NS, etc.) with their corresponding class (`-class`) and options (`-opt`). The `{global-d-opt}` represents global DNS server-specific configuration or options.
    - You can also perform local domain lookups by querying a local DNS server using the `@local-server` address, which should be replaced with your actual local server IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1). The `{local-d-opt}` corresponds to any options or configuration specific for queries on a local DNS server.

   To display more detailed help and obtain a complete list of available `dig` command options, use either:
   ```
   dig -h
   ```
    This displays the standard usage information with basic details about each option.

   OR (to view it in a paginated manner):
   ```
   dig -h | more
   ```
    The `|` symbol is used as a pipe to redirect the output of `dig -h` command into another program, called 'more', which allows you to scroll through the help information page one screen at a time. By using this method, you can easily explore all available options and their descriptions in detail.

Remember that the `--help` flag (or `-h`) should work for standard `dig` command usage; however, if it's not recognized by your particular implementation or version of dig, make sure to use one of the alternative methods mentioned above to access comprehensive help information.

Examples:

1. Invalid option usage: `--help` without digging into the detailed help content using `dig -h`. This approach skips directly to the instructions rather than utilizing provided tools for a comprehensive understanding, which is not ideal.

2. Misuse in command line with insufficient context: "dig --help" executed alone provides helpful information but may lead to confusion when combined without full domain or query specification (e.g., `dig @example.com -h`). This can result in an incomplete understanding of the dig tool's functionality, as it doesn’t show practical usage scenarios.

3. Inconsistent command formatting: Using "dig --help" with incorrect spacing ("dig-help") could confuse users due to non-standard syntax, leading them away from actual documentation or help content for dig.

4. Omission of critical information in quick reference: Someone might use "--help" as a shortcut but miss out on understanding specific query types (q-class) and options (`{q-opt}`), which are crucial when conducting detailed queries with dig.

5. Ignoring local server support: By solely relying on "dig --help", users might not realize the utility of specifying a local server (e.g., `--local`) for testing or debugging purposes, thus limiting their understanding and ability to fully utilize dig's capabilities in different environments. 

These examples illustrate how an over-reliance on just "dig -h" without considering contextual usage can lead to misunderstanding or underutilization of the dig command’s full potential. It is essential to explore both help content and practical application for a holistic understanding.
