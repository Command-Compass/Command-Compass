Explanation:

To execute a wget command with various options for downloading content over the internet, you can use the following format:

```
wget [options] [URL]
```

Here are some examples of how to utilize common options mentioned in your request:

1. Download using PEM private key and CA certificate bundle:
   ```
   wget --private-key-type=PEM --ca-certificate=/path/to/ca_bundle.pem [URL]
   ```

2. Recursive download with specified maximum recursion depth, deletion after downloading, and backups:
   ```
   wget -r -l 3 -d -b40 [URL]
   ```

3. Download an HTML page while accepting only images and JavaScript files (accepted extensions):
   ```
   wget --accept=jpg,jpeg,png,js [URL]
   ```

4. Set the priority string for ciphers directly:
   ```
   wget -ciphers "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384" [URL]
   ```

Remember to replace `[options]` and `[URL]` with your desired options and the URL you want to download.

Examples:

To download files using wget with specific options and configurations, you can use the following command:

```bash
wget --recursive -p -k -o warc-file.warc.gz --mirror https://example.com/files/*
```

In this example, we are downloading all files from `https://example.com/files/` recursively and converting links (`--mirror` option), preserving original file permissions (`-p`), backing up converted files as `.orig`, compressing WARC output files (`--warc-file`), and redirecting to the WarC info page (included in the URL).

You can adjust this command based on your specific needs by adding or removing options according to the provided wget documentation. Some key options shown:

- `--recursive`: Specifies recursive download.
- `-p`: Turns on preserving of permissions and directory structure.
- `-k`: Converts links in downloaded files.
- `-o warc-file.warc.gz`: Saves request/response data to a `.warc.gz` file (Web ARChive).
