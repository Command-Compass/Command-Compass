Explanation:

The `df` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to display the file system disk space usage of the mounted filesystems on a computer. It provides detailed information about each file system, including total size, available space, percentage used, and more. This information can be vital for managing storage resources efficiently. Here's an extensive explanation of its options:

- **Usage**: `df [OPTION]... [FILE]...`
  The primary syntax is `df <file_system>`, where `<file_system>` specifies the target file system to display information about, and can also be omitted for listing all mounted filesystems by default. You can provide multiple targets separated by space.

- **Required Options**:
   - `-a` or `--all`: Include pseudo, duplicate, inaccessible file systems in output. This is useful when troubleshooting issues related to the disk usage of these non-standard file systems.
   - `-B`, `-b`, `-BM`, `-bm`: Scales sizes by the provided size (`SIZE`). For example, `--block-size=1K` scales sizes in blocks of 1024 bytes (a kilobyte), and `--block-size=1M` for megabytes.
   - `-h`, `--human-readable`: Prints file system usage details in a more human-friendly format, e.g., `1023M`. This option is automatically applied if no block size is specified (using the default 1024 bytes per block).
   - `-H`, `--si`: Displays sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., `1.1G`).
   - `-i`, `--inodes`: Replaces normal usage information with a listing showing file system size and number of inodes used. This can help identify if an issue is related to disk space or the total number of available inodes on the filesystem.
   - `-k` (equivalent to `--block-size=1K`): Scales sizes by 1024 bytes per block for a kilobyte size unit, which is useful when working with file systems that are formatted using this block size internally.
   - `-l`: Limits the output only to local mount points (excludes network filesystems). This helps focus on the disk space usage of mounted drives directly attached to your computer.
   - `--no-sync` or `-n`: Disables syncing the file system before getting its information, which can speed up performance but risks data loss if interrupted by a sudden power outage.
   - `--output[=FIELD_LIST]`: Specifies the output format using `FIELD_LIST`, with each field separated by a comma (e.g., 'source,file'). The default is to print all available fields.
   - `-P` or `--portable`: Uses POSIX-compliant formatting for sizes and percentages, which can be more easily processed programmatically but might not provide the most intuitive human-readable output.
   - `-s` (equivalent to `--sync`): Synchronizes file system data before getting its usage information. It's recommended when checking disk space as it ensures that all temporary files are flushed and committed to permanent storage, but this can be time-consuming for large filesystems.
   - `-t`, `--type`: Limits the output to entries matching a specific file system type (e.g., `ext4`).
   - `-T` or `--print-type`: Prints only the type of each mounted filesystem, which is useful when you're more interested in knowing what types are being used rather than their detailed usage information.
   - `-x`, `--exclude-type=TYPE`: Excludes entries that match a specified file system type (e.g., `ntfs`). This can help focus on the desired filesystems for monitoring or troubleshooting purposes.
   - `--help` and `--version`: Display this usage message and version information, respectively.

**Optional Arguments**:
- `-k`, `-K`: Same as `--block-size=1K`.
- `-h` (equivalent to `--human-readable`) and `-H`: Same as above, but applies by default if no block size is specified.

**Value Displaying Rules**: 
Values displayed are in units of the first available `SIZE`, which can be set using environment variables like `DF_BLOCK_SIZE` or `BLOCK_SIZE`. By default (unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is set), values use powers of 1024, also known as "kibibytes" (KiB). If the size is specified in bytes and using binary prefixes, it uses base-2 measurements such as KiB, MiB.

**Size Arguments**: `SIZE` can be an integer or a unit (e.g., 10K for 10*1024). Valid units include K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, and Y, representing powers of 1024, as well as binary-prefixed variants like KB (Kibibytes), MB (Mebibytes), etc.

**FIELD_LIST Arguments**: When using the `--output` option, `FIELD_LIST` is a comma-separated list of fields to be included in the output (e.g., 'source,file'). Valid field names are 'source', 'fstype', and so onâ€”these describe various properties of each file system entry, including its size, type, available space, used capacity, etc.

**Additional Information and Resources**:
GNU coreutils' `df` documentation is online at `<https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`, where users can find more details about the command's functionality and various usage examples. The GNU project also maintains a dedicated website for each of its utilities, including `df`.

By understanding these explanations, you should be able to effectively use the `df` command in your shell scripts or terminal sessions.

Examples:

1. Display all information about the file system on which a specific file resides:
   ```bash
   df /path/to/file
   ```

2. Show information for each file system, or default to all by omitting arguments:
   ```bash Written in English. Here's an example command without any arguments:
   ```bash
   df -h

3. Display usage and help information about the `df` command:
   ```bash
   df --help
   ```

4. Show total space used on all file systems, excluding insignificant entries:
   ```bash
   df -T

5. Limit listing to local file systems only:
   ```bash
   df -l

6. Display block sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes (KiB) for human-readability:
   ```bash
   df -hk

7. List inode information instead of block usage:
   ```bash
   df -ii

8. Limit listing to file systems with the specified type (e.g., ext4):
   ```bash
   df --type=ext4

9. Use POSIX output format for displaying file system information:
   ```bash
   df --portability

10. Display GNU coreutils' online help or local documentation via the info page for `df`:
    ```bash
    info '(coreutils) df invocation'
    ```
