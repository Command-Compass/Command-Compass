Explanation:

The `cut` command in Unix-like operating systems is a versatile utility used for extracting sections from each line of input, commonly text files or standard output. It can be applied to manipulate and customize the content based on specified options. The usage details provided describe various functionalities that you can leverage with the `cut` tool through its short (`-`) and long option flags (also known as GNU's "long" options).

Here are some practical examples of how each feature described can be utilized:

1. **Selecting specific bytes, characters or fields**: If you want to extract a range of bytes from a file, use `-b` along with the byte range in the format `N-M`, where N is the starting byte and M is the ending byte (inclusive). To select specific characters, you can utilize the `-c` option followed by the character positions or ranges. Similarly, for fields extraction, apply the `-f` flag along with a list of field numbers to target.

Example:  
To extract bytes from 10th to 25th and print them: `cut -b 10-25 filename.txt`.  
For characters between positions 3rd and 7th, use `-c 3-7`: `cut -c 3-7 filename.txt`.  
To select fields 4 and 8: `cut -f 4,8 filename.txt`.

2. **Delimiter settings**: The `--delimiter` option allows you to specify a delimiter character or string that separates the fields in each input line (default being TAB). This can be particularly helpful when dealing with comma-separated values files where commas are used as delimiters, but you want to extract specific columns.

Example:  
To use "," instead of TAB for field separation: `cut -d ',' --delimiter=',' filename.csv`.

3. **Zero-terminated lines**: With the `-z` option, each line is terminated with a null character (`\0`) rather than newline. This can be useful when working with data streams where newline characters are absent or inconsistent (e.g., some files created by non-text editors).

Example:  
Extracting fields from a file using zero termination `-z`: `cut -f 2,4 --zero-terminated filename.txt`.

4. **Selecting complemented sets**: The `--complement` option allows you to exclude selected bytes, characters or fields rather than explicitly including them. This is essentially the inverse of the other options and can be used for various purposes like data sanitization or filtering.

Example:  
To select all but bytes from 10th to 25th position: `cut -b -c 1-9,26- filename.txt`.

5. **Only delimited lines**: The `-s` option enables printing only those input lines that contain the specified delimiter(s). This feature can help in situations where you're dealing with data streams containing many empty or unrelated records and wish to focus on meaningful entries.

Example:  
To extract fields from lines containing commas, using default TAB as a delimiter: `cut -f 2,3 --only-delimited filename.csv`.

6. **Setting output delimiters**: The `--output-delimiter` option lets you define the string that will be used to separate selected bytes, characters or fields in the resulting output. This can help customize how extracted data is presented for further processing or analysis.

Example:  
To set a pipe symbol (`|`) as an output delimiter while extracting bytes from 10th to 25th position: `cut -b 10-25 --output-delimiter '|' filename.txt`.

In summary, the `cut` command provides robust and flexible capabilities for text processing tasks, allowing users to efficiently manipulate data in Unix-like environments through various options for selecting bytes, characters, fields, delimiters, and more.

Examples:

1. Selecting specific characters from a file using the `-c` option with multiple ranges:

   ```bash
   cut -c 2-5,8-13 example.txt
   ```
   
   This command will print only the 2nd to 5th and 8th to 13th characters from each line in `example.txt`.


2. Printing specific bytes with multiple ranges using the `-b` option:
 ---USER 1---

 Please provide examples for every argument "Usage: cut OPTION... [FILE]... Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. --bytes=LIST select only these bytes --characters=LIST select only these characters --delimiter=DELIM use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter --fields=LIST select only these fields; also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless --s option is specified --complement complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields --only-delimited do not print lines not containing delimiters --output-delimiter=STRING use STRING as the output delimiter The default is to use the input delimiter --zero-terminated line delimiter is NUL, not newline --help display this help and exit --version output version information and exit "
