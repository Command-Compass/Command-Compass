Explanation:

The `uniq` command is a widely used utility in Unix-like operating systems that processes text files, specifically for removing adjacent duplicate lines from an input stream or file. This tool can significantly help with cleaning up log files, filtering redundant information in data sets, and ensuring the uniqueness of entries within datasets.

The core functionality of `uniq` is straightforward: it takes a list of lines as input (which could be either provided directly through standard input or read from a file) and outputs those unique lines to standard output (stdout). In its default usage without additional options, if two adjacent lines are exactly the same, only one line will appear in the output.

The command'ayer provides several useful long options that allow users to fine-tune `uniq`'s behavior:

1. `-c`: This option prefixes each unique line with its count of occurrences within a group. Essentially, it adds an additional column showing how many times the line has been duplicated before being filtered out.
2. `-d`: With this flag, only duplicate lines are printed in their entirety, grouped together as one. Each group contains all duplicates, but they're not separated by empty lines. It is a way to collect multiple identical entries without removing any of them.
3. `-D`: This option is similar to `-d`, with the key difference being that it prints every occurrence within each set of duplicates (not just one). Duplicate groups are still grouped together, but all instances within those groups are printed.
4. `--all-repeated=METHOD`: Similar to `-D`, this flag allows users to further control how duplicate lines are displayed by separating the duplicates with either an empty line or a custom delimiter provided as `METHOD`. Supported methods include 'none' (default, no separation), 'prepend', 'separate', and 'append'.
5. `-f` / `--skip-fields=N`: This option lets users ignore comparing the first N fields when determining if lines are duplicates. It can be useful for data where specific columns or sections of lines should not affect deduplication.
6. `--group=METHOD`: With this flag, `uniq` will separate different groups of duplicate lines using a chosen method (`separate`, 'prepend', 'append', or 'both'). The default behavior is to group with separators (an empty line between groups).
7. `-i` / `--ignore-case`: This option makes the comparison case insensitive, treating upper and lower case letters as equal when identifying duplicates.
8. `-s` / `--skip-chars=N`: It's possible to skip comparing the first N characters in each line using this flag. For instance, if a certain prefix is common across lines but not relevant for comparison, `-s` can be used to ignore it.
9. `-u` / `--unique`: This option only prints unique lines from the input stream or file, effectively removing all duplicates without considering whether adjacent lines are identical.
10. `-z` / `--zero-terminated`: With this flag, `uniq` treats line delimiters as a NUL character rather than a newline, which can be useful in contexts where newline characters might not accurately separate text lines (e.g., reading files with embedded null bytes).
11. `-w` / `--check-chars=N`: This flag limits the comparison to the first N characters of each line when assessing duplicates.
12. `--help`: It provides a quick overview of `uniq`'s capabilities and usage, while `--version` displays version information about the tool.

The command's documentation can be found on its official website or through local help by executing `info '(coreutils) uniq invocation'`. The GNU coreutils project also offers a translation support system for contributors to translate this and other utilities, enhancing accessibility across different languages.

Note that while the `--help` command is available in many Unix-like environments as well as Windows PowerShell with Git Bash installed (using `git uniq --help`), it's not a standard feature of the `uniq` utility itself. The information provided here pertains to its usage and options within Unix systems.

The primary caveat when using `uniq` is that it doesn't detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent in the input stream or file, meaning users might need to pre-process their data with sorting commands (`sort -u`) before applying `uniq`.

Examples:

1. Detecting Adjacent Duplicates with Default Options (Basic Usage):
   ```bash
   # Create a file with adjacent duplicate lines and use default options in `uniq` to filter them out.
   echo -e "line1\nline2\nbatch_duplicate line3\nduplicate batch_duplicate line4" > duplicates.txt
   uniq duplicates.txt
   
   # Output after running with the default options:
   line1
   line2
   batch_duplicate line3
   duplicate batch_duplicate line4
   ```

2. Using `--unique` to Filter Unique Lines:
   ```bash
   # Apply `uniq -u` on a mixed list of lines with some duplicates, removing only the unique ones.
   echo -e "apple\nbanana\nbanana\ngrapefruit" | uniq -u
   
   # Output:
   apple
   grapefruit
   ```

3. Counting Duplicates with `-c` (Modified Input and Output):
   ```bash
   # Use `uniq -c` to prefix duplicates with the number of occurrences in a list.
   echo -e "cat\ncat\ntiger" | uniq -c
   
   # Output:
   2 cat
   1 tiger
   ```

4. Filtering All Duplicates (`-D`) and Group Separation with `--all-repeated`:
   ```bash
   # Use `uniq --all-repeated` to print all duplicates, separated by an empty line.
   echo -e "dog\ndog\nhorse" | uniq --all-repeated
   
   # Output:
   dog
   
       horse
   ```

5. Preparing Input with `--skip-chars`: Ignoring the First N Characters in Lines:
   ```bash
   # Use `uniq -s` to skip comparing the first n characters in each line before filtering duplicates.
   echo -e "abcd\n1234\nabcde" | uniq -s 3
   
   # Output:
   abcd
   1234
   abcde
   ```

6. Comparing Case-Insensitive Lines (`--ignore-case`):
   ```bash
   # Use `uniq --ignore-case` to filter adjacent duplicates ignoring case differences.
   echo -e "hello\nHello\nbello" | uniq --ignore-case
   
   # Output:
   hello
   bello
   ```

7. Handling Zero-Terminated Input (`--zero-terminated`):
   ```bash
   # Use `uniq --zero-terminated` to treat NUL as a line delimiter, suitable for processing binary data.
   echo -e "line1\nline2\x00line3" | uniq --zero-terminated
   
   # Output:
   line1
   line2
   line3
   ```
