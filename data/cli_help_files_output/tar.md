Explanation:

To list files in the archive using the specified options, you can use the following command:

```bash
tar -tf <archive_file> --force-local --xattrs=MASK --verbose
```

Replace `<archive_file>` with the path to your actual tar file. The `-t` option lists files in an archive, `--force-local` ensures it operates on the local filesystem, and `--xattrs=MASK` enables xattr support based on a provided mask (for example, '*' for all). The `--verbose` flag increases verbosity of output.

To extract files with specific transformations, you can use:

```bash
tar -xf <archive_file> --transform='s/oldname/newname/' -C /desired/directory
```

Replace `<archive_file>` with your tar archive path and `/desired/directory` with the destination directory where extracted files should be placed. The `--transform` option allows you to apply a sed-style transformation; in this case, it changes 'oldname' to 'newname'. Adjust the pattern as needed for your specific use case.

Remember that tar options can have multiple effects, so careful reading of their descriptions and documentation is essential when crafting custom commands for complex tasks.

Examples:

As a tar command, you can use the following options and arguments to manipulate files in an archive:

Archive creation and manipulation options:
-a, --auto-compress: automatically determine compression program based on the archive suffix.
--use-compress-program=PROG: force use of PROG for filtering (must accept -d).
--bzip2, --lzma, --xz, --gzip: compress with specified filters.
--no-overwrite: prevent overwriting existing files in the archive.
--no-same-owner: skip setting file owner/group after extracting archives.
--no-recursion: treat all paths as non-recursive (not supported by some implementations).
--progress, --info, --checkpoint=NUMBER, --checkpoint-action=ACTION: display progress and control checkpoints.
--totals=[SIGNAL]: print total bytes after processing the archive when signal is sent; allowed signals are SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGINT, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2.

File manipulation options:
-x, --extract: extract files from an archive to a specified directory or strip directories in tarballs with the -t option.
--no-recursion: treat all paths as non-recursive (not supported by some implementations).
--ignore-failed-read: continue extraction even if reading failed for some files in tarballs.
--verbose, --warning=KEYWORD: set warning controls and verbosity level.
--quoting-style=STYLE: specify file name quoting style (allowed values are literal, shell, shell-always, shell-escape, shell-escape-always, escape, c, c-maybe, locale).
--transform=EXPRESSION: use sed replace to transform file names.

File and archive information options:
-c, --create: create a tarball with the given name.
-t, --list, --name-only, --file-status: list files in an archive without extracting them; with -l option also show block numbers (if supported by implementation).
--no-same-owner: skip setting file owner/group after extracting archives.
--no-symlinks: do not follow symbolic links during extraction or listing of tarballs.
--long, --full-names: print full path names for files instead of relative paths (default).
--old-archive, --checkpoint-time: interpret archive timestamps as Unix epoch times in seconds and output them in local time (default is not supported by some implementations).
--verbose: display verbosely when listing or extracting files.
--show-snapshot-field-ranges: show valid ranges for snapshot-file fields during extraction.
--show-transformed-names, --show-stored-names: show file names after transformation during creation and extraction.
--no-dereference, --no-xattrs, --no-acls: do not dereference symbolic links or preserve xattr/ACL attributes while extracting archives.
--check-links: print a message if some files are missing from the archive during extraction (default behavior).

Compatibility options:
-o, --old-archive: create an old tarball with same functionality as modern tar but limited capabilities for compatibility reasons.
-w, --interactive, --confirmation: prompt before performing destructive operations like extracting or deleting files in the archive.
--restrict: disable use of potentially harmful options (default behavior).

Additional information and help options:
-?, --help: provide a list of all available options.
--usage: display a short usage message for this tool.
--version: print program version number.

Remember to specify the necessary arguments when using tar, such as the name of the archive or file, the operation you want to perform (e.g., create, extract), and any additional options required for that operation.
