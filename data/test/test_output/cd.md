Explanation:

The `cd` command in Unix/Linux operating systems is a built-in shell command that allows users to change their current working directory within the terminal or shell environment. The provided script breakdown of the `cd` command offers an insight into its usage, options and behavior:

```bash
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the HOME shell variable.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing DIR. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name is the same as the current directory. If DIR begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set, the word is assumed to be  a variable name. If that variable has a value, its value is used for DIR.
    
Options:
      -L	force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic links in DIR after processing instances of `..'.
      -P	use the physical directory structure without following symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before processing instances of `..'.
      -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status.
      -@	on systems that support it, present a file with extended attributes as a directory containing the file attributes.
    
The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified. '..'' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.

Exit Status:
Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when -P is used; non-zero otherwise.
```

To use `cd` command with its options in Bash shell, here are some examples:

1. Change to a specific directory by providing the pathname as an argument (`dir` parameter):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory
   ```

2. Set the default working directory to your home directory (by using HOME variable):
    ```bash
    shift + r, then type "cd" and press Enter. The shell will change to your home directory:
   ```

3. Change to a specific directory while following symbolic links (-L option) or without following symbolic links (-P option). In this case, the behavior defaults to `-L' as if -L were specified. To use it explicitly:
    ```bash
    cd -L /path/to/directory  # Follows symbolic links
    cd -p /path/to/directory   # Does not follow symbolic links (default)
    ```

4. When using the `-e` option, if the directory cannot be determined successfully and `cdable_vars' is set:
    ```bash
    cd -e /path/to/directory  # Non-zero exit status if error occurs
    ```

5. To present a file with extended attributes as a directory (using `-@` option):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/extended_attributes_dir
   touch /path/to/file.txt
   setfattr -x gecos /path/to/file.txt  # Adding extended attribute "gecos" to file with value "your custom text"
   cd -@ /path/to/extended_attributes_dir   # This will present the file as a directory, but it's just for demonstration purposes and may not work on all systems.
   ```

The exit status of `cd` command is based on whether the directory change was successful or not: 0 indicates success while non-zero means failure (typically due to issues in finding or changing directories).

Examples:

1. **Basic Directory Change**: Changing to a specific directory using default options.

   Example: `cd /usr/local`

   This command changes the current working directory to `/usr/local`. It follows symbolic links, so if `/usr/local/bin` is a symlink pointing to `/opt/bin`, the actual change will be made to `/opt/bin`.

2. **Using CDPATH**: Changing directory using directories listed in `CDPATH`.

   Example: Assuming `CDPATH=~/sandbox:/usr/local` and current directory is `/home/user`, executing `cd -` would navigate the user back to either `~/sandbox/` or `/usr/local`, depending on which one exists.

3. **Forcing Symbolic Link Resolution with -L**: Following symbolic links during a change of directory.

   Example: `cd -L /foo/../bar` changes the current working directory to `/bar`. The `-L` option ensures that any symlinks encountered in this path are followed, resolving them as needed.

4. **Ignoring Symbolic Links with -P**: Changing directory without following symbolic links.

   Example: `cd -P /foo/../bar` changes the current working directory to `/foo`. Since `-P` is used, any symlinks encountered in the path are ignored and do not affect the change of directory.

5. **Using Extended Attributes with -@** (assuming a compatible system): Presenting an attribute-encumbered file as if it were a directory during a `cd`.

   Example: On a Unix-like system that supports extended attributes, you might have a special file like `/path/to/attrs.ext`. Executing `cd @/path/to/attrs.ext` could present this file's attributes as if it were a directory structure for demonstration or debugging purposes (the specific implementation may vary across different systems).

6. **Error Handling with -P and Non-Existent Directory**: Attempting to change to a non-existent directory without symbolic link resolution.

   Example: `cd -P /nonexistent` would fail, returning a non-zero exit status because the current working directory cannot be determined successfully (assuming `cdable_vars` is set and `/nonexistent` doesn't exist).

These examples demonstrate how different options of the `cd` command can impact its behavior when changing directories.
